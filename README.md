# Summer Analytics 2025 – IIT Guwahati 🚀

Welcome to the official repository for my work during **Summer Analytics 2025**, organized by **IIT Guwahati**. This repository tracks my learning journey, practical implementations, and project contributions throughout the camp.

## 📂 Branches Overview

This repository contains two key branches representing different phases of the camp:

---

### 🔹 [`camp-submissions`](https://github.com/arpit-sonar/Summer_Analytics_25/tree/camp-submissions)

This branch includes:

- ✅ All **assignments** submitted during the camp
- ✅ Completed **quizzes** with solutions
- ✅ A **Hackathon Notebook** demonstrating applied analytics and data science skills in a real-world scenario

The work in this branch reflects regular learning milestones and individual tasks from various modules of the Summer Analytics program.

---

### 🔹 [`Capstone-Project`](https://github.com/arpit-sonar/Summer_Analytics_25/tree/Capstone-Project)

This branch contains the final **Capstone Project**, developed as the culminating task of Summer Analytics 2025.

Key highlights:

- 📊 **Two machine learning models** built from scratch
- 🔄 Real-world dataset processing and predictive analytics
- 📁 Well-structured codebase 

This project demonstrates the end-to-end application of data analysis, model building, and insight generation.

---

## 📌 Objective

The aim of this repository is to showcase the hands-on work done during the **5-week analytics bootcamp**, covering:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling
- Real-time analytics (in Hackathon and Capstone)

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Use of ML and DL Algorithms
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Data visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Pathway and Kafka for Real-Time Data Processing
- Git & GitHub for version control

---

## 📁 How to Explore
